<!-- 
use strict is a directive that was introduced in ECMA script 5.
It changes the way javascript is executed, if we use strict on any context, fucntion or global, 
that block of code will not ignore any code violations & will result in to exceptions, that are other wise 
usually silently ignored. By its nature javascript is very linient & allows us to writed coed that can have adverse 
effect, but using strict allows us to write secure javscript. Things that will get reported as errors inlcude...

1:  Using or accessing a nondeclared variable.
2:  Creating duplicate properties.
